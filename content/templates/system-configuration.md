# System configuration

## Configuration management

> How is configuration managed for the system?

_(e.g. CloudInit bootstraps the installation of Puppet - Puppet then drives all system and application level configuration except for the XYZ service which is configured via `App.config` files in Subversion)_

## Secrets management

> How are configuration secrets managed?

_(e.g. Secrets are managed with Hashicorp Vault with 3 shards for the master key)_
