# Security and access control

## Password and PII security

> What kind of security is in place for passwords and Personally Identifiable Information (PII)? Are the passwords hashed with a strong hash function and salted?

_(e.g. Passwords are hashed with a 10-character salt and SHA265)_

## Ongoing security checks

> How will the system be monitored for security issues?

_(e.g. The ABC tool scans for reported CVE issues and reports via the ABC dashboard)_
